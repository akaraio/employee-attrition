# employee-attrition

The code starts by loading and preprocessing a dataset from a CSV file, handling missing values, data types, and feature engineering. It then explores the distribution of variables and relationships between them using histograms, heatmaps, and correlation plots to understand the characteristics of employees who leave or stay with the company (Attrition). Finally, it trains a Random Forest Classifier on preprocessed data to predict Attrition and evaluates its performance using classification report and confusion matrix, saving the trained model for future use.
